## üöÄ About Me

I love solving problems. During college, I discovered the power of automation and have been passionate about building better systems ever since. My journey took me from automating my first job to leading engineering teams and architecting enterprise SaaS platforms. I thrive on watching visions come to life in the hands of talented teams and believe in driving positive, meaningful change through technology.

Since the rise of Generative AI, I‚Äôve stayed on the bleeding edge, connecting with leaders and building the future of AI. I contribute to the [AI Biz Hour podcast](https://aibizhour.com/) and regularly share insights on the evolving AI landscape.
